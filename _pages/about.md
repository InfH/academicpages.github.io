I'm a molecular biologist and data scientist, and currently a member of the data management team in Development Sciences Informatics at Genentech. I lead our data planning team, which facilitates transfers of high-dimensional exploratory data from our partners, striving to ensure that our data is [FAIR](http://go-fair.org). I also lead our data management team's efforts in data sharing, especially in support of publications.

Previously, I held primary appointment as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in [John Ngai's lab](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/ngai) at UC Berkeley. I was also a **Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow** at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/). I studied how olfactory stem cells make neurons (or don't) in adults. 

I mapped my academic career as a visual resume. Aside from its descriptive qualities, this project was a great way to learn more about Google sheets integration with R and ggplot2/grid graphics. The result is below and [the code to make your own visual resume is on GitHub](https://github.com/diyadas/vizresume).
